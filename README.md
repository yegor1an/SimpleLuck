100 People × 1 Cent per day = 1 Dollar per day

This Project is created for make the Planet better.
How it works:
You donate 1 Cent.
If only you have donated 1 Cent, you have 100% chance to become 1 Cent back.
If you and your friend have donated 1 Cent, you have 50% chance to become 2 Cent. (×2)
If 1 Million people have donated 1 Cent, every people have a chance to become 10000 Dollars. (10 Thousand)
If 8 Milliard People have donated 1 Cent, 1 Human of the Earth become 80000000 Dollars. (80 Milions)
The General rule is only one, you can donate only 1 Cent per day.
I think it would be great, if every Human donated only 1 cent per day and every day, 1 of them become unreal big Bag of Money.
This can really change a life every Human and his Family.
I hope you have understood my idea and that this world can be better.
